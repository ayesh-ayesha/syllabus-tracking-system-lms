## 🚀 Overview
A **Flutter-based mobile application** designed to help educational institutes **structure syllabi and track student progress** when course content is delivered outside the app (classroom sessions, PDFs, videos, etc.).

Instead of hosting learning material, the app focuses on **clarity and accountability** by providing students with a checklist-style roadmap of course outlines, while allowing admins to manage courses, enroll students, and view progress.

## 💡 Why This Project?
Many Learning Management Systems focus heavily on content delivery (videos, quizzes, assignments). However, in many coaching centers and institutes, teaching happens outside digital platforms.

This project focuses purely on **progress visibility and accountability**:
1. **Clarity:** Students know exactly which topics are completed and which remain.
2. **Structure:** Admins define and manage syllabus outlines centrally.
3. **Visibility:** Both students and admins can clearly see course progress at any time.
