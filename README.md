### 🚀 Overview
**A Digital Syllabus Tracker that bridges the gap between Student clarity and Admin control.**

This application solves the common problem of **"Syllabus Confusion"** in coaching centers. Instead of overwhelming students with content, it provides a clean, interactive roadmap (checklist) of topics. Students track their own progress, while Admins retain full oversight and access control.

### 💡 Why This Project?
Most LMS (Learning Management Systems) are bloated with video content and complex quizzes.
This project focuses purely on **Accountability**:
1.  **Clarity:** The student knows *exactly* what is left to study.
2.  **Control:** The Admin knows *exactly* who is working and who isn't.
